steps i took to setup:

- created frontend and backend folders
- use 'npm init -y' to create package json in the root dir.
- ran 'npm install express mongoose dotenv' to install those packages in root dir.
- created backend/server.js
- created .gitignore

- had to first create repo on github then use these
  git remote add origin git@github.com:danieladeboladada/resume-generator.git 
  git push -u origin master 

- setup server js with express listening on port 3000
- added "type": "module" to package json to enable es6 imports
- added dev script to package json: "dev": "nodemon backend/server.js"
- installed nodemon as a dev dependency: npm i nodemon -D

- went to mongodb website, create a project, then created a cluster, it created a db user, 
- connect to cluster > connect using drivers > get connection string and put in .env file as MONGO_URI
- on mongodb website, set network access to allow access from anywhere (which adds 0.0.0.0/0 to the IP Access list)

- created backend/config/ and db.js to setup mongoose connection to mongodb using the MONGO_URI from .env
- use connectDB() function in server.js to connect to db when server starts

- made credentials model in backend/models/credentials.model.js to allow us add to credentials collection in DB
- made post route to create login credentials.
- setting up postman to test the post for creating credentials.
- more api stuff. e.g. /login 
- setup router and controller to organize how routes will call endpoints.

frontend
- set up this using vite by running: `npm create vite@latest .` > select 'react' > 'javascript'
- above also installs the packages using npm.
- followed the steps for 'using chakra in vite' on https://chakra-ui.com/docs/get-started/frameworks/vite to get set up.
- removed css we weren't using and refs to it.
- installed react router dom using `npm i react-router-dom` and then wrapped appliation using BrowserRouter
- created pages and app-components folder. coding starts here.
