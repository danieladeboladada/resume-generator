steps i took to setup:

- created frontend and backend folders
- use 'npm init -y' to create package json in the root dir.
- ran 'npm install express mongoose dotenv' to install those packages in root dir.
- created backend/server.js
- created .gitignore

- had to first create repo on github then use these
  git remote add origin git@github.com:danieladeboladada/resume-generator.git 
  git push -u origin master 

- setup server js with express listening on port 3000
- added "type": "module" to package json to enable es6 imports
- added dev script to package json: "dev": "nodemon backend/server.js"
- installed nodemon as a dev dependency: npm i nodemon -D
